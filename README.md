# Portfolio Project Codecademy

This project is part of the codecademy full-stack engineer course. The goal of
the project is to create a website using HTML, CSS that shows off some of my
work so far. It's requirements are that it has a homepage that shows projects
as well as another page with contact information. The website should be
responsive and have at least one interactive element implemented using
javascript. I will be using all of those things and will likely be using flask
or django as a proper web backend.
