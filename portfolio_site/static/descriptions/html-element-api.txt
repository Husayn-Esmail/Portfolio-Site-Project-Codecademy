This project was given to me as part of an interview. They asked me to find the last element on a web page using fastAPI, a python framework for the web. I created this project but in the end didn't get selected or really even hear anything back from the employer which is really disappointing. However, I did learn a little bit along the way. I still would have preferred some feedback on why so that I could grow more.
