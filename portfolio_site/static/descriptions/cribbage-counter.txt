At one point I got really into the card game cribbage. Cribbage requires a board and a deck of cards usually and the first player to 61 or 121 points wins. Often I would have a deck of cards but the cribbage board was too combersome to carry around. I naturally always had my apple watch with me. So I created an app to keep track of points, Intense cribbage players would not be happy with this solution, but the people I play with don't care so it worked. The app counts points for the game and has the ability to choose between the shorter or longer game mode and it will automatically stop the game once a player has reached the target points.
